## 📖 About The Project

The **DSA Visualizer** is a desktop-based educational tool designed to help users learn and understand how data structures and algorithms work internally through graphical animations and interactive steps.

This application covers a wide range of data structures like **Stack**, **Queue**, **Linked List**, **Tree**, **Graph** and algorithms like **Sorting**, **Searching**, **Traversal**, and more — visualizing their operations (insert, delete, search, sort, etc.) in real-time.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Visualize key data structures such as:
- Stack
- Queue
- Singly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Graph (DFS/BFS Traversals)

✅ Visualize important algorithms like:
- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Traversals: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level Order (for trees)

✅ Real-time animations for operations like:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversals
- Swapping (for sorting)

✅ User-friendly GUI built with **Java Swing**

✅ Step-by-step execution and control flow

✅ Code snippet display for each operation

✅ Clear, colored, and interactive visual components for easy understanding

## 📊 How It Works

1. User selects the **Data Structure** or **Algorithm** they want to visualize from the main menu.
2. Provides input data (either manually or randomly generated).
3. The application performs the selected operation step-by-step.
4. Real-time animations display the process visually.
5. Optional: Displays the code snippet or pseudocode for better learning.
