# DSA-Visualizer
A Visual Approach to understand Data Structures and Algorithms

The DSA Visualizer is a tool designed to help students and learners understand Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through visual representation. It provides step-by-step animations for arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, showing how elements are added, removed, and accessed. The tool also demonstrates searching algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search and sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. Users can see how each algorithm works in real-time, making it easier to understand complex concepts. Built using Java, the tool ensures smooth execution and interactive learning. By offering a visual way to explore DSA, it helps learners grasp concepts more effectively, improve problem-solving skills, and gain deeper insights into how data structures and algorithms function. This tool makes learning DSA easier, more engaging, and accessible to students, educators, and programmers.
